# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task

+ generate code
+ check command line flags (-t [input], -c [input])
- REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop)
{
    validate input
    ....
}
+ linear sequence program
+ DRY implementation
+ syscall implementation

## Description
The problem was solved by creating specific functions for each portion of the program using
void(). Afterwards, the void() functions are plugged into the main() function, using conditional 
statements, syscalls, C methods and creating a linear sequence for easier readability 
for the developer(s).

## Installation
The program is installed via the terminal in the IDE and uses a Makefile for compilation purposes of the project.
Once the Makefile rules are outlined, the developer runs 'make && ./my_mastermind',
utilizing the executable command in order to test the program. 
## Usage
The program passes all of the unit tests and works accordingly. 
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
